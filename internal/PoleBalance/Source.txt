1. NeuralNet
Each neuron has weight values and the facilitation value of the neuron. It will 
be considered as a homogenous quantity to the genetic algorithm.

2. GenAlg
It uses the chromosome which includes all the weights and facilitation rates
from a neural network. 

a chromosome

To the GenAlg, they don't see the facilitation value rather it is just one of
weight values. 'weight' terminology is not the right choice for the genetic 
algorithm's point of view. 

There is no distinction between the weights and the facilitation rate in the 
genetic algorithm. It considers them as a homogenous quantity, so called 
'weights.' So, weights in genetic part mean the weight values and the facilitation
rate.

3. CartPole
CartPole has a neural network. This network is used in an epoch, and then the
network is replaced with another network generated by the genetic algorithm.

Then, who makes the neural network structure which is important when we need to 
add another feature like facilitation rate. It is definately CartPole who is 
in charge of the network structure.

4. NeuGen
Random weights and facilitation rates generated in GenAlg should go to the 
NeuralNet as an initial values
