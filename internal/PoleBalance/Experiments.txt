The first experiment was designed to test the hypothesis that the sensory 
feedback delay will degrade the performance of the network.

To examine the reason for the xxx, a second experiemtn was performed in which we
examined the conditions necessary for the prediction ...



0. The effect of Sensory feedback delay in the motor control

A network trained in no delay condition will be tested in 5 different delay 
conditions which are no, 1, 2, 3, and 4 steps delay.

All the networks are trained with no sensory feedback delay

		Delay0	Delay1	Delay2	Delay3	Dealy4
----------------------------------------------
Net#1	5000
Net#2	5000
...		...
Net#10	5000
----------------------------------------------
avrg	5000	4300	500		..		...

(*) Draw the graph

** To overcome this delay, we can think the facilitation rate!!!

1. The effect of the facilitation rate in no sensory feedback dely condition

We can use the table that was made in 'the facilitation rate vs. learning speed'

(*) Draw the graph

2. Facilitation rate vs. learning speed  <<<<<<<<<- I'm doing this

- All neurons share a same facilitation rate value
- Change facilitatin rates from 0 to 1 by increasing 0.1
- Repeat this under delay conditions from 0 step to 5 steps

success: balance the pole until 5,000 steps (50 seconds)

		facilitatio rate			
		0		0.1  ----    0.9	1
delay	
0		gen#	gen#

...
5
-----------------------------------------
Repeat this 10 times and average them.
--> the relationship between the facilitation rate and learning speed.

(*) Show the facilitation rate makes the network learn faster than the case of 
no facilitation.

3. Evolve the facilitation rate (0 <= f <= 1)

Show networks trained more sensory feedback delay is more robust the black-out
condition.

			b.o
			0		5		10		20		40		60		80
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Delay0		Net#1  step#
			Net#2
			...
Delay1		Net#1  step#
			Net#2
			...
...
Delay4		Net#1  step#
			Net#2
			...
(*) Delay3 or 4 has the better than the others especially in long black-out 
duration.

4. Evolve the facilitation or decaying rate (-1 <= fd <= 1) ---> maybe next??
